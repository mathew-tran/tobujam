I'll become the first successful businessman in the family.
And Mama's gonna be more proud of me!
Have you told her yet, that you work as a janitor?!
Well.. anyways. It's gonna be a week before I buy the place. 
It's gonna be 2,000 dollars! I bet you can't even make that kind of money in your life!
Later. I gotta run to the bank.
Heh.. Heh...  *Chuckles*
See you next week!"
